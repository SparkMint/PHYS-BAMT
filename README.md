PHYS-BAMT
=========

Phys-Bamt is a PhysX Project for a Physics Simulation assignment. We were given a premade engine and were asked to fix it up and create a ball game thats physically accurate to its real world counterparts.

I chose to make an 8 Ball-Pool game where you have 45 seconds to pot as many balls as you can before the timer is up. Once the timer ends, a huge cueball is fired and destroys your table
